    "# Fourier Transform\n",
    "## Basis Set\n",
    "* Any signal can be described in terms of a set of signals and this set is called the Basis Set\n",
    "* A basis set B of a vector space V is a linearly independant subset of B that spans V\n",
    "* More formally, Suppose that B = {v1, v2, ... vn} is a finite subset of a vector space V over the field F (i.e, real / complex, etc...), then B is the basis set if\n",
    "  1. Linear Independance\n",
    "$$\\forall a_{1},...a_{n} \\in F, if a_{1}v_{1} + ... + a_{n}v_{n} = 0 \\textrm{ then necessarily}$$\n",
    "$$a_{1} = ... = a_{n} = 0$$\n",
    "  2. Spanning Property\n",
    "$$\\textrm{For every x in V it is possible to choose }a_{1}, ..., a_{n} \\in F \\textrm{ such that }$$\n",
    "$$x = a_{1}v_{1} + ... + a_{n}v_{n}$$\n",
    "* Typically basis set is orthogonal. Think of the X & Y axis to be the Basis set of the entire Real space. But they don't have to be. It's easier to visualize if they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fourier Series\n",
    "* Consider an image to be a single point in a NxN space. Basically flatten the image into a single 1D array right.\n",
    "$$[x_{00},x_{10},...x_{10},x_{11},...x_{(n-1)(n-1)}]$$\n",
    "* One normal vector to this image would be\n",
    "$$[0,0,0,...,0,1,0,...,0,0,0]$$\n",
    "  * Definitely independant from all the other normal vectors\n",
    "  * Can span the entire image space, i.e. can create any image\n",
    "  * Not at all helpful :P\n",
    "* A very useful set of basis would be the following\n",
    "![Fourier](img/Fourier.png)\n",
    "  * Each of the basis set is a sinesoidal of varying freqencies. \n",
    "  * Basically how much does each frequency in each of the directions add weight to in the image.\n",
    "  * **Any periodic signal can be rewritten as a weighted sum of sines and cosines of different frequencies**\n",
    "  * Any signal can be described by a set of signals of the form\n",
    "$$A\\sin(\\omega x + \\phi)$$\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Fourier Transform\n",
    "* So to convert the time domain signal to freq. domain, we will need to find the correponding A and \\phi of each of the omega\n",
    "* The fourier transform will give us this, it gives us the A and the \\phi using complex numbers\n",
    "$$F(\\omega) = R(\\omega) + iI(\\omega)$$\n",
    "$$A = \\pm\\sqrt{R(\\omega)^2 + I(\\omega)^2}$$\n",
    "$$\\phi = \\tan^{-1}\\frac{I(\\omega)}{R(\\omega)}$$\n",
    "* **Note**: Integrating sines of two different frequences gives us 0 because they cancel each other out. Unless the two sines are of the same frequency\n",
    "$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\sin(ax+\\phi)sin(bx+\\theta)dx = 0 \\forall a \\neq b$$\n",
    "* Then if we take some function\n",
    "$$f(x) = \\cos(2\\pi\\omega x)$$\n",
    "$$C(u) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}f(x)\\cos(2\\pi ux)dx$$\n",
    "  * will be 0 for all u != omega\n",
    "  * will be infinity when u = omega and u = -omega.\n",
    "  * Hence it produces two **impulses**\n",
    "* Now assume that f(x) is instead the image with multiple frequency components\n",
    "  * Now all u's which are there in f(x) will generate impulses and all other u's won't.\n",
    "  * This then becomes our basis set for this image, as we are finding out the frequency components of the image.\n",
    "* **Formally for 1D**\n",
    "$$F(u) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}f(x)e^{-i2\\pi ux}dx$$\n",
    "$$\\textrm{Where: }e^{ik} = \\cos(k) +i\\sin(k)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitation\n",
    "* f(x) should be integrable for the fourier transform to exist. This should happen as long as the time domain signal is bounded in space. If it's a time infinite signal, then it might not be integrable.\n",
    "  * Dosen't exist in real world, but does in mathematician's heads :P\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discrete Fourier Transform\n",
    "* For 1D\n",
    "$$F(k) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{x=0}^{N-1}f(x)e^{-i\\frac{2\\pi kx}{N}}$$\n",
    "  * k is the cycles per image and this is bounded by -N/2 to N/2, because we can't have more cycles than N/2.\n",
    "    * If the pixels are changing from black to white every alternate pixel, then we'll have a total of N/2 cycles in the image.\n",
    "  * And loop only around the image. The image (signal) is bounded in space. So no worries.\n",
    "* For 2D\n",
    "$$F(k_{x},k_{y}) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{x=0}^{N-1}\\sum_{y=0}^{N-1}f(x,y)e^{-i\\frac{2\\pi (k_{x}x + k_{y}y)}{N}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Applications\n",
    "* The high frequency components is what gives us the edges, so if we do a LPF on an image, we basically get an edge image.\n",
    "* Interesting example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBohnSCII0c. This is where we use the wrap border ;)\n",
    "* **WHEN IN DOUBT, FIX YOUR LIFE WITH A GUASSIAN**"

    "* Convolutions in the spatial domain is multiplication in the frequency domain and vice-versa\n",
    "$$f(x) = g(x) * h(x)$$\n",
    "$$F(u) = G(u)H(u)$$\n",
    "  * When the mask (h) is very large, converting to freq. domain, multiplying and converting back might be faster than a regular convolution\n",

    "* Famous fourier pairs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz9fw2TuNE\n",
    "* Instead of gradually tapering of the unrequired frequencies using a regular filter, if we instantly terminate the unrequired frequencies, it leads to bad noise in the picture, because the image is unable to compensate for odd deformities\n",
    "  * If we implement a rigid LPF, it'll result in ringing, where we have crisscrossing lines running through the image\n",

    "## Impulse Train\n",
    "* Brilliant explaination: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knwBcBdfMq8\n",
    "* Let's define a comb filter (impulse train)\n",
    "$$comb_{M,N}(x,y) = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\sum_{l=-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\delta(x-kM,y-lM)$$\n",
    "  * Where delta is a single impulse\n",
    "  * As M increases, the impulse gets more spaced apart\n",
    "  * Think of impulses in the 2D space as white spots every M pixels\n",
    "  * The fourier transform of this is another impulse train, where the distance between each impulse is the inverse of the distance between each impulse in the spatial domain.\n",
    "  * \n",
    "\n",
    "## Aliasing\n",
    "* When we undersample, the reconstruction can result in harmonics of this signal, remember the hats in the freq domain!!.\n",
    "![Aliasing](img/aliasing.gif)\n",
    "* In images, aliasing can be both temporal (where the fps isn't sufficient to display the effect, or spatial, where we don't have enough pixels to display the required frequency changes (remember the N/2 limitation during fourier transform)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anti-Aliasing\n",
    "* Join the mega pixel craze... :P\n",
    "* Better is for us to put a LPF\n",
    "  * We'll lose a bit of information\n",
    "  * But it's better than aliasing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical applications\n",
    "* Resizing the images\n",
    "  * Careful when sub-sampling the images\n",
    "  * One solution is to add a **guassian upfront before subsampling**\n",
    "* Image Compression\n",
    "  * Check out [Campbell-Robson Contrast Sensitivity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzCDxRgm-ks) on where the human vision system is sensitive\n",
    "  * So DCT and IDCT are used by JPEG to add more bits to low freq components and use very less bits to the higher frequency components. Hence we can compress by droping information from the higher frequencies which our vision system can anyway not see well."
